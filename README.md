#### Minimum Requirements
* **.NET Standard 2.0** or later
* **.NET Framework 4.6.1** or later
* **TLS 1.2** or later

***Note:*** If you are using **.NET Framework 4.6.1** you will need to ensure your application is using **TLS 1.2** or later. This can be configured via the registry ([**link 1**][1], [**link 2**][2]) or configured at ***application startup*** by setting the following value in `ServicePointManager`:
```csharp
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
```

### Download & Install
**Nuget Package [Coinbase.Commerce](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Coinbase.Commerce/)**

```powershell
Install-Package Coinbase.Commerce
```

Usage
-----
### Getting Started
You'll need to create **Coinbase Commerce** account. You can sign up [here](https://commerce.coinbase.com/)!

### Receiving A Simple Crypto Payment
Suppose you want to charge a customer **1.00 USD** for a candy bar and you'd like to receive payment in cryptocurrency like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum** or **Litecoin**. The following **C#** creates a checkout page hosted at **Coinbase Commerce**:

```csharp
var commerceApi = new CommerceApi(apiKey);

// Create a unique identifier to associate
// the customer in your system with the
// crypto payment they are about to make.
// Normally, this is a unique ID for your
// customer inside your database.
var customerId = Guid.NewGuid();

var charge = new CreateCharge
   {
      Name = "Candy Bar",
      Description = "Sweet Tasting Chocolate",
      PricingType = PricingType.FixedPrice,
      LocalPrice = new Money {Amount = 1.00m, Currency = "USD"},
      Metadata = // Here we associate the customer ID in our DB with the charge.
         {       // You can put any custom info here but keep it minimal.
            {"customerId", customerId}
         },
   };

var response = await commerceApi.CreateChargeAsync(charge);

// Check for any errors
if( response.HasError() )
{
   // Coinbase says something is wrong. Log the error 
   // and report back to the user an error has occurred.
   Console.WriteLine(response.Error.Message);
   Server.Render("Error creating checkout page.", 500);
   return;
}

// else, send the user to the hosted checkout page at Coinbase.
Server.Redirect(response.Data.HostedUrl);
```
When the customer is redirected to the `HostedUrl` checkout page on **Coinbase** the customer can pick their preference of cryptocurrency to pay with as shown below:  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bchavez/Coinbase.Commerce/master/Docs/charge.png" />

It's important to keep in mind that the customer has **15 minutes** to complete the payment; otherwise the payment will fail.

### Look Ma! No Redirects!
It's totally possible to perform a checkout without any redirects. *"Whaaaat?!"* I hear you say... That's right, you just need to roll your own custom **UI**.

In the previous example, if the charge creation was successful, you'll get back a `Charge` object in `response.Data` that looks like the object shown below:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "code": "SOMECODE",
    "name": "Candy Bar",
    "description": "Sweet Tasting Chocolate",
    "logo_url": null,
    "hosted_url": "https://commerce.coinbase.com/charges/SOMECODE",
    "created_at": "2018-04-04T19:45:34+00:00",
    "expires_at": "2018-04-04T20:00:34+00:00",
    "confirmed_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
    "checkout": null,
    "timeline": [
      {
        "time": "2018-04-04T19:45:34+00:00",
        "status": "NEW",
        "context": null
      }
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "customerId": "30025397-adff-4d80-8e9f-c231b582be85"
    },
    "pricing_type": "fixed_price",
    "pricing": {...},
    "payments": [],
    "addresses": {
      "ethereum": "0xeb294D2BCb1Cf25cBEBd0bF55160aA655F82D8c0",
      "bitcoin": "1KgpR5rQmFpfvxQKdPsL9jU8FPf35xmjvn",
      "bitcoincash": "DGVC2drEMt41sEzEHSsiE3VTrgsQxGn5qe",
      "litecoin": "LXWELKEw124ryu3hbwzBJPUy81odeLthkv"
    }
  },
  "error": null,
  "warnings": null
}
```
Wonderful! Notice the `data.addresses` dictionary of `bitcoin`, `ethereum` and `litecoin` addresses above. So, instead of sending a redirect like the last example, you can use these crypto addresses to generate **QR codes** in your custom **UI**. The same timelimit and rules apply, the customer has **15 minutes** to complete the payment. 

### Webhooks: 'Don't call us, we'll call you...'
If you want to receive notifications on your server when **Charges** are *created*, *confirmed* (aka completed), or *failed* you'll need to listen for events from **Coinbase** on your server. You can do this using [Webhooks](https://commerce.coinbase.com/docs/api/#webhooks).

Go to the **Settings** tab in your **Coinbase Commerce** account and create a **Webhook Subscription** as shown below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bchavez/Coinbase.Commerce/master/Docs/webhook_sub.png" />

:bulb: **Protip:** Consider using [smee.io](https://smee.io/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to help you debug webhook callbacks while in development.

When a `charge:created`, `charge:confirmed`, or `charge:failed` event occurs, **Coinbase** will `POST` **JSON** to your `/callmebackhere` endpoint. The **HTTP** `POST` looks something like:

```
POST /callmebackhere HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: weipay-webhooks
Content-Type: application/json
X-Cc-Webhook-Signature: cb22789c9d5c344a10e0474f134db39e25eb3bbf5a1b1a5e89b507f15ea9519c
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3
Accept: */*
Connection: close
Content-Length: 1122

{"attempt_number":1,"event":{"api_version":"2018-03-22","created_at":"2018-04-04T23:49:00Z","data":{"code":"8EKMDPVQ","name":"Candy Bar",...."description":"Sweet Tasting Chocolate","pricing_type":"fixed_price"},"id":"f6972c57-c100-4e64-b47c-193adecfadc6","type":"charge:created"}}
```   
The **two** important pieces of information you need to extract from this **HTTP** `POST` callback are:

  * The `X-Cc-Webhook-Signature` header value.
  * The ***raw*** **HTTP** body **JSON** payload.

The value of the `X-Cc-Webhook-Signature` header is a `HMACSHA256` signature of the ***raw*** **HTTP** **JSON** computed using your **Webhook Shared Secret** as a key.

The `WebhookHelper` static class included with this library does all the heavy lifting for you. All you need to do is call `Webhookhelper.IsValid()` supplying your **Webhook Shared Secret** key, the `X-Cc-Webhook-Signature` header value in the **HTTP** `POST` above, and finally the ***raw*** **JSON** body in the **HTTP** `POST` above.

The following **C#** code shows how to use the `WebhookHelper` to validate callbacks from **Coinbase**:

```csharp
if( WebhookHelper.IsValid("sharedSecretKey", webhookHeaderValue, Request.Body.Json) ){
   // The request is legit and an authentic message from Coinbase.
   // It's safe to deserialize the JSON body. 
   var webhook = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Webhook>(Request.Body.Json);

   var chargeInfo = webhook.Event.DataAs<Charge>();

   // Remember that customer ID we created back in the first example?
   // Here's were we can extract that information from the callback.
   var customerId = chargeInfo.Metadata["customerId"].ToObject<string>();

   if (webhook.Event.IsChargeFailed)
   {
      // The payment failed. Log something.
      Database.MarkPaymentFailed(customerId);
   }
   else if (webhook.Event.IsChargeCreated)
   {
      // The charge was created just now.
      // Do something with the newly created
      // event.
      Database.MarkPaymentPending(customerId)
   } 
   else if( webhook.Event.IsChargeConfirmed )
   {
      // The payment was confirmed.
      // Fulfill the order!
      Database.ShipCandyBar(customerId)
   }

   return Response.Ok();
}
else {
   // Some hackery going on. The Webhook message validation failed.
   // Someone is trying to spoof payment events!
   // Log the requesting IP address and HTTP body. 
}
```
Sample callback processing code for ASP.NET can be [**found here**](https://github.com/bchavez/Coinbase.Commerce/issues/1#issuecomment-382912551). Easy peasy! **Happy crypto shopping!** :tada:
